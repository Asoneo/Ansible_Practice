# Ansible_Practice
Practice project for learning Ansible, the main objective is to control other machine (Probably VMWare Worstation VMs) to boot/maintain services

# Environnement
[OLD] Installed Ansible on WSL Ubuntu, VMWare Workstation installed on Windows host

Since WSL is in NAT network, it has it's own network range, and thus cant communicate with VMWare VM

[NEW] Two Ubuntu VM on VMWare Workstation connected via bridge network
